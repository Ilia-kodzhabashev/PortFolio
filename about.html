        <h4>My world of dreams and inspiration</h4>
        <p>
            <br>My name is Iliya Kojabashev. I am creative, positive, responsible. My biggest passion is to develop, to
            learn new things, to improve my knowledge and skills. I love reading, playing sports, and learning new
            technologies. I wanted to turn my passion into a job, so I became a programmer. Being able to motivate and
            inspire is what I strive for in my work.
            <br>
            <br>I believe in hard work, in smiles, in the fact that every problem is just a hidden opportunity. I am not
            afraid of challenges, I am not afraid of mistakes, because they are a faithful helper on the path to
            improvement.
            I will be really happy to be part of the world of programming and creating new worlds. To give my small
            contribution to its development, because I love what I have chosen to do.
