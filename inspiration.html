        <h4>My story</h4>

        <p> <strong>Hello. Nice to meet you. My name is Iliya.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>I know who I am, I know where I am and where in life I want to arrive. And I would like to share with
            you my
            dream to be a successful developer and a better person.
            <br>

            <br>I was born in a really small village where there are not many people who are brave enough to try and do
            not
            have the interest to discover the world and find a better place where they can live. I want to change my
            life, to make it better and better, to visit every beautiful place on Earth, to get to know every culture,
            and feel every vibe and emotion.
            <br>
            <br>I built my first personal computer all by myself when I was 10 years old, and everything has changed. I
            felt
            in love with these machines. But, I never succeed in getting the answer to how they work, what language they
            use to communicate, and how they become the result we all see. I have never understood all of this until
            2019. A seminar I visited, made me choose my path. It came like an avalanche and hit me so hard and
            emotional: the discovery that the machines, I love using so much and all the people in the whole world use
            daily, communicate with a language - just like us, with syntax and grammar, and all the stuff a language
            has. So in fact, they are smart just like us.
            <br>
            <br>I have chosen front-end development because I wanted to rediscover my personality, to wake up my
            creativity.
            I started with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but I wasn't happy enough like I was missing something important.
            And then I heard about ReactJs, and I felt an emotion, unknown before. Back then, I did not have any idea
            what it is but I was so motivated to understand. This powerful framework changed my whole life. And it keeps
            doing it. It makes me happy to work with React because it is complicated, but simple and clear at the same
            time.
            <br>
            <br>When it comes to my plans, in the nearest future, I want to achieve rank Fullstack developer with NodeJs
            and
            all Javascript frameworks except Angular.
        </p>
